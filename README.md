# MovieApp
Part of Udacity's Android Nanodegree program <br /> <br />


In this project, I built an app to help users discover popular and recent movies. <br />
I built a clean UI, sync to a server, and presented information to the user. <br /> <br /> <br />


The app will:<br /><br />

Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch. <br />
Allow your user to change sort order via a setting. <br />
The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated.<br />
Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:<br />
• original title<br />
• movie poster image thumbnail<br />
• A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)<br />
• user rating (called vote_average in the api)<br />
• release date <br />
Allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser). <br />
Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.<br />
Allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).<br />
Create a database to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies.<br />
